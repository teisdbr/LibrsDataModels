# LIBRS Models

This is the official repository for the Louisiana Incident Based Reporting System (LIBRS) Data Models. These models are used in our new JSON Validator, and should be considered in Beta. 

The Models are built for C#, as that is the primary language that LIBRS is developed in these days. If you are a Java developer, or use another language, and would like to contribute by converting these models into your language of choice, feel free to make a pull request!

This library can be found on Nuget.org here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibrsModels/

# Documentation

Documentation for these models can be found on the librs tech spec page, https://docs.librs.org/models
