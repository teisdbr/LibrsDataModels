# LIBRS Models

Hey, howdy. 

This is the repository for our LIBRS Data Models. Specifically, this repository includes the C# Models that are used by the LIBRS JSON Validator. 

We primarily work with C# for these kinds of things, so if you are a Java developer (or anything else) and would like to contribute these models in the language you use, we'd love to get a Pull Request from you!

Nuget packages of these models can be found here:
